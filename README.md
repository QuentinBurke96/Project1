# Introduction 
Flash Cards has been used to help aid memorizing things that a person wishes to remember. I personally have used this throughout my life. This project is to display what has been learned so far at the beginning of this lifelong journey.

# Main Technology 
* HTML
* CSS
* JS

# Info
I made use of LocalStorage, which allowed to save key value paires in a web browser making an array to hold data from the flashcards. Content wont display on the screen if localStorage is in use. Still dont know to muc about but very usefull nonetheless 
i.e, localStorage.setItem("key", "value"); 

# Major hurdles 
* The activation of the buttons used to Add, Save, Delete and Close cards.
* Getting Background image to size up or down with the page. 

# INSTALLATION
* Make a new directory titled FinalFantast CardFlash
* Touch script.js, style.css and index.html into the repository
